## Project Structure

The project makes use of the MVVM architecture along with the repository pattern wherby view models will use the repository fa√ßade, instead of performing these operations themselves. In turn, view models transform and expose model data to views to display on-screen. 

No third party libraries were used and testing has been applied to all relevant layers.
